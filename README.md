# new-to-python
Zero to hero... hopefully.


I will be following the pthw book and lessons in order to learn, improve, and develop my python skills.
My goal with this repo is for other sys admins who are new to python to have a starting point and see progress.
This will not be intended as a course, simply my road to python expertise.
